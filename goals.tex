\subsection{Goals}
Before the actual design of the system, I set out the following goals that I had in mind for the finished product:
\begin{description}
\item [Simplicity] The system must be intuitive and easy to use; no real explanations should be required for any aspects of the system. 
\item [Speed] The response time of the system for any user actions should be very quick since this system will typically be used in a situation where the user has no time to waste. 
\item [Elegance] A clean, elegant, uncluttered interface is a must. Only put what is needed on the interface.  
\item [Accuracy] We do want accurate results for the users, although this must not come at the cost of one of the other goals.
\item [Integration] The two user components of the system must blend together seamlessly. If a user can use one component they will also feel completely at home using the other. 
\end{description}
