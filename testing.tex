\section{Testing}

Due to the fact fact that the project encompasses three different spheres, we
needed to test each component individually as well as the system as a whole. 
Testing the whole system is difficult was mostly done via user testing and
seeing what sort of data the system could cope with. Throughout our
system EclEmma\~cite{emma} was used to determine what portion
of our code was covered by the unit tests and Findbugs\~cite{findbugs} was used to provide static
analysis of our code.
