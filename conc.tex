\section{Conclusion}

Thus far I feel that the project has progressed well. The issues I have encountered were mostly due to a lack of experience with the tools that I chose to work. For example, initially the GUI of web application was badly written due to UiBinders not being used. This made the application slow and the interface clunky. The GAE Datastore was also switched to the Cloud SQL without conducting research into the billing which would be later be added to its use. So this led to the system having to be migrated back to the GAE Datastore.\\
The Web front-end prototype functions well with the App Engine Datastore. It is fast, responsive and easy-to-use. The Visualisation and Maps APIs blend into the application seamlessly. \\
The system now needs to be extended to fully integrate with the Android mobile application in order to allow the system to actually fulfil its intended function. \\
The main lesson that can be taken from the system thus far is that proper research, planning and design is essential. Furthermore scheduling for different stages of the project must be done well in advance in order to avoid rushing aspects thereof to meet deadlines.
