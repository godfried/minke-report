\subsubsection{Graph Viewer}
The Graph Viewer was implemented using the following classes in the *.client.gui.graph package:
\begin{description}
\item[HistoryGraph] A container for the ScatterGraph class which also loads the Visualization API. Also provides a communication interface between ScatterGraph and the rest of the system.
\item[ScatterGraph] A container for a ScatterChart~\cite{scatter} which loads a new chart when provided with data.
\item[GraphSelectHandler]A SelectHandler~\cite{select} for the ScatterChart.
\end{description}
