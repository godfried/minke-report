\subsubsection{Directions Viewer}
The Directions Viewer was implemented using the following classes in the *.client.gui.map package:
\begin{description}
\item[BranchLocation] A container for the DirectionsMap class which also loads the Maps API. Also provides a communication interface between DirectionsMap and the rest of the system and allows the user to change their location.
\item[DirectionsMap] A container for a MapWidget~\cite{mwidget} and a DirectionsPanel~\cite{dpanel} which loads a new map and directions when provided with data in the form of a LatLng~\cite{latlng} map center and a String~\cite{string} containing an origin and a destination.
\end{description}
