\subsection{GWT}
Testing of our web client code was done with unit tests (for testing data and
logic) and user testing (for testing the interface) . The unit tests were mainly
done to ensure that some of the calculations and operations (such as regular
expressions) done client side performed correctly and allowed us to see what would happen when the client was
faced with unexpected input. 
User testing was done by:
\begin{itemize}
\item entering extreme values into input areas to ensure that validation and
  input handling was done correctly,
\item repeatedly switching between views to test how the application handles
  sudden changes in state,
\item closing and refreshing the application repeatedly to determine what kind
  of state it and the server retains, and
  \item using the Eclipse debugger to find problems in the client code. 
\end{itemize}
