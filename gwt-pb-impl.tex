\subsubsection{Product Browser}
The Product Browser was implemented using the following classes in the *.client.gui package:
\begin{description}
\item[popup.ProductSearch] A popup which allows the user to search for products by name, as well as to browse for them by category and/or location. This then sends the search request to the Datastore via WebPage, WebSystem and RPC.
\item[table.ProductList] This presents the user with a tabular display of the products they searched for. This is created once the above RPC has successfully completed. It contains buttons to access ProductDetail and GraphTypePopup.
\item[popup.ProductDetail] This popup displays extra information about a chosen product.
\item[popup.GraphTypePopup] This allows the user choose what type of chart they which to view, in terms of the products they wish to have displayed. This will then take the user to the Graph Viewer.
\end{description}
