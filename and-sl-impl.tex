\subsubsection{Shopping List Browser}
The Shopping List Browser is only partially implemented thus far, with only some of the GUI being designed.
These are the components which have been created:
\begin{description}
\item[ShopScreen] This presents users with a shopping list to which they can add Products.
\item[ShopListAdapter] This is used to display Products on the ShopScreen.
\end{description}
