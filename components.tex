\subsection{System Components}
The Minke system will consist of three major components: A GWT web-side front-end, a GAE Datastore back-end and an Android mobile application. 
The GWT component will provide a web front-end for users to view information about product price histories and determine the best location to do their shopping at. Admin users will also be able to edit data on this platform. The Android application will be the primary source of data for the system and will rely on users scanning product tags at various stores. GAE will provide our web application's hosting and a Datastore for the entire system.
