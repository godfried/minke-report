\subsection{GAE}
The main testing of our server side code was done with unit tests. The tests
mainly ensured that our queries to our database returned the expected values and
that the operations we performed on these values had the expected results. GAE
provides the following libraries to access its runtime APIs in a testing
environment:
\begin{itemize}
  \item appengine-api.jar
  \item appengine-api-labs.jar
  \item appengine-api-stubs.jar
  \item appengine-testing.jar
\end{itemize}
Using the LocalServiceTestHelper\~cite{gae-test} class we can then access its
APIs locally and test whether the server provides the required functionality.
Our principle tests here were to with the retrieving and storing data.
