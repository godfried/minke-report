\subsection{Android}
The Android component of the system was implemented with the Android 4's design principles in mind. 
This means that the ActionBar has taken over the role traditionally occupied by the menu in previous versions of Android. 
Furthermore, emphasis has shifted away from Activity-centric to Fragment-oriented applications which allows for faster,
 more dynamic and interactive applications. With this in mind it was decided to
 implement the main section of our application as a single activity, called
 HomeActivity, which hosts different tabs for each main view (Product Scanner,
 Product Browser and Shopping List Browser) of our application.
 Each view would then be implemented as a series of Fragments which would move in and out of
 their respective tabs depending on the state of the view. The other views in
 our application (Graph View and Directions View) will be implemented as
 seperate activities which can be launched from our HomeActivity. Unfortunately
 much of this required functionality is not compatible with Android versions
 older than Honeycomb, therefore we needed a workaround. Fortunately this was
 available in the form of ActionBar Sherlock and androidv4, libraries which
 provide us with Android 4 functionality on older versions of Android.
