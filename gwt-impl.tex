\subsection{GWT}
The GWT front-end has several central components which facilitate interaction between the subsystems described in Design.
These are:
\begin{description}
\item[WebSystem] The central system which:
\begin{itemize}
\item Controls how the system interacts with the GAE Server,
\item Requests data for and loads data into the Graphical User Interface (GUI),
\item Serves as the entry point for the system, and
\item Binds the different components together.
\end{itemize}  
\item[RPC] Responsible for interacting with the Datastore via RPCs. It provides the following services:  
\begin{itemize}
\item ClassService
\item BranchProductService
\item ProductService
\item ProductCategoryService
\item LocationService
\item GeoService : Determines user location using a GWT implementation of HTML5's GeoLocation~\cite{geo} interface.
\end{itemize}
 \item[SystemData] Stores data pulled from the Datastore.
 \item[WebPage] The central GUI which holds the various components and
 facilitates interaction between them.
  \item[ViewTree] Provides sidebar with shortcuts to each of the major components. 
\end{description}
Most of the actual layouts of GUI components was done in xml and then bound to
classes with a UiBinder.
