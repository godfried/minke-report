\subsubsection{Graph Viewer}

The Graph Viewer will consist of a single chart which will display a line plot of date against price for the chosen products. 
A scatter plot will be used if the number of data points becomes to high for the line plot to present a good visual display. 
Google's GWT Visualization API~\cite{viz} will be used to create the graph.
