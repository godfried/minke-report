\subsubsection{Directions Viewer}

The Directions Viewer will consist of a Directions Display and a Map Display. The  Directions Display will be a textual
description of how to arrive at a given location from the user's location. The Map Display will relay this same information on a map. Google's GWT Maps API~\cite{gmaps} will be used to create the map and display the directions.
