\subsubsection{Shopping List Browser}
The Shopping List Browser was implemented using the following classes in the *.client.gui package:
\begin{description}
\item[popup.shoppinglist.ShoppingList] A popup which allows the user to add products to their shopping list via a SuggestBox~\cite{suggest}. This then sends the request for Branches which stock the products to the Datastore via WebPage, WebSystem and RPC.
\item[popup.shoppinglist.ShoppingListItem] A Composite~\cite{comp} GUI class used to represent a Product on the shopping list. Allows the user to adjust the quantity of a Product as well.
\item[table.BranchList] This presents the user with a tabular display of the Branches which stock the Products on their shopping list. This is created once the above RPC has successfully completed. It contains buttons to access ShoppingListDetail and the Directions Viewer.
\item[table.ShoppingListDetail] A table which displays the shopping list for a particular Branch. It therefore allows the user to see the price of each Product. It contains a button to access the Graph Viewer.
\item[popup.ShoppingListDetailPopup]A popup used to hold ShoppingListDetail.
