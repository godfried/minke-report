\subsubsection{Directions Viewer}
The Directions Viewer was implemented using MapsActivity to display our map
and directions in and GoogleParser to request directions from Google's
Directions API and parse so that they can be used in our application. Directions
are displayed in a dialog which can be accessed via a button on the ActionBar
and each intruction can be clicked on which will show the instruction on the
map.
