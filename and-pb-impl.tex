\subsubsection{Product Browser}
The Product Browser is only partially implemented thus far, with only some of the GUI being designed.
These are the components which have been created:
\begin{description}
\item[ProductScreen] Allows the user to search for a Product via suggestion boxes. This proceeds to BrowseScreen upon a successful search.
\item[BrowseScreen] This presents the user with a tabular display of the Products they searched for. It a button to access Graph Viewer.
\end{description}
